# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

Requirements Implement a React component that renders a simple game.

In the game, the player needs to match a country to its capital by clicking on appropriate buttons.

Your component should receive a data property in the following format (an object with the correct answer, where the keys are the names of the countries and the value of each key is the capital of the country):

<CountryCapitalGame data={{ Germany: "Berlin", Azerbaijan: "Baku" }} /> A button should be displayed for each country and each capital. So, the example above would return four buttons: Germany , Berlin, Azerbaijan and Baku.

The buttons should be displayed in a random order.

Clicking a button should set its background color to blue (#0000ff).

Clicking another button should:

remove both buttons if a correct country and capital pair has been selected; set the background color of both buttons to red (#ff0000) if a wrong pair has been selected. Assuming the previously selected pair was wrong, clicking another button should restore the default background color of the wrong pair and set the background color of the clicked button to blue (as in point 4).

When there are no buttons left, display a message: Congratulations.
